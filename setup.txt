This script automatically pulls data from youtube API, based on the most recent keyword typed in the Slack channel. At the moment, it is configured, to check every minute 
for new keywords typed in a channel. If a new keyword is read, then the script returns the message back to the channel about the new monitored keyword. 
(This could be improved by reading events from Slack Events API, but as I understand, it would require having a distinct URL for Slack to send events to). 
This way, we can change what we look for while the script is running, without the need for reconfiguration.

To keep this script running, I would use something similar to Windows Task Scheduler.
(I know there are many much more sophisticated software for that, but I can only speak from experience, and that is a software I have at least some experience)

So this kind of script could be used in two ways:
Keep it running. This method would have predefined time periods inside the script when certain functions would run. 
Running a task on a schedule. This method would predefine times when the script would run inside a scheduler.

I think the most efficient method would be chosen based on the expected results. If we want to only get results of one keyword every 24h, it wouldnâ€™t make much sense,
to keep it running forever. Otherwise, if we want to have more control over what we are looking for, it would be better to have a script running and have the ability 
to change the monitoring keyword on demand via Slack.
